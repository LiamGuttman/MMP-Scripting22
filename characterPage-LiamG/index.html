            <h2>About Gordon</h2>
                
                <p>At one point in time, Gordon was just an average MIT graduate, until one day at the Black Mesa Research Facility changed everything.
            During a standard testing day at the facility, a "resonance cascade" was created, and alien creatures invaded our world. Gordon fought his way through the facility and was able to stop this threat. For a few years, Gordon completely vanished off the face of the Earth. During that time, a new alien species known as the Combine took control over Earth, causing the reappearance of Freeman. Hailed as the silent savior of the human race, Gordon likes to spend his free time with long drives across the beach.</p>

                <h2>Who?</h2><hr>
                <p>Liam Guttman is a first-year student in the Multimedia Production program at Lethbridge College. He has been working towards becoming an expert in content creation and game development. In his free time, he likes to find new things to learn about or create, using a wide range of software he taught himself how to use. From Photoshop to Premiere, or Blender to Illustrator, he has a large toolset to work on any project. </p>
                
                <p>Liam was born in Brooks, and lived in Scandia, Alberta until 2022, when he moved to Lethbridge to pursue a career in media. As a kid he dreamed of making comics, videos, and video games. In 2016 he started learning how to create videos and animations, and in 2018 he started learning GameMaker Studio 2. In 2021, he used that software to create his first real game, <a href="https://pixelrino.itch.io/zeus" target="_blank">“Z.E.U.S: The Faulty Robot.”</a> This game won first place in his high school’s first ever game jam. Ever since, he has been planning to develop more games and work with others to create something amazing.</p>
				
                <p>Liam was also able to recently work on a small video game project, doing low resolution 3D models and textures for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931020/Slayers_X_Terminal_Aftermath_Vengance_of_the_Slayer/" target="_blank">“Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer.”</a> The project lead was incredibly pleased with his work and asked him multiple times to model or texture more items. The game is currently planned to be released in January 2023, and Liam can’t wait for everyone to see his work. </p>

                <h2>Things I Want To Do (That Might Happen Someday)</h2><hr>
                <p>To be honest, there are a lot of things I want to create in the future. Let's start this with my game development goals. One of my first plans out of high school was a full retail version of <i>Z.E.U.S.</i>, but that plan has been pushed back for the future. Currently, I've been cooking up ideas for a 2D RPG/Platformer game, taking place within a small town and a twisted up "dream reality."<br>Additionally, if I ever find myself working with 3D assets, I have been considering the option of taking that same concept and building it in 3D using Unreal Engine or Godot Engine. There are upsides and downsides to both dimensions, so it's going to take a bit of time to figure out.</p>
				<p>When it comes to other media types, I want to explore almost all of it. Video editing, voice acting, writing, I want to do a little bit of everything at some point. Stuff like creating my own action/comedy shorts, doing some voice acting for games and animation, or even just editing videos for a YouTube channel. Everything is possible out here, and I can't wait to see what happens. <br> <b>-Liam</b></p>
